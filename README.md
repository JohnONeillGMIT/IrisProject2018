# IrisProject2018
Programming and Scripting Module Project

1. Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it.
2. Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
3. Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
4. Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and mean of each column of the data set.
  A Python script will quickly do this for you.
5. Write a summary of your investigations. 
6. Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary.

Background Information.
The Iris Data set contains measures of 4 variables on 3 Species of the Iris plant(Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). The four measures are: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). The sample size is 150.

Suaamry:
Sample Size = 150
Variables measured = 4 (length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres)
Species= 3  (setosa, versicolor, virginica)
)

This data set was used in R.A. Fisher's 1936 paper, "The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems". Ref
An inital review of the data shows that the characteristics of the Iris-setosa are distinct in measurements from the Iris-versicolor and virginica.

It is apparent that this data set is commmonly used as sample data inputted to demonstrate "machine learning" and Predictive Data analyitics.
The analysis of the data and use of graphs gives useful insight to the characteristics of the 3 species of Iris. The key to good data analyitics it is argued is that stored inforamtion is most useful in that it is used to produce new information (Cokins)... it the case of the Iris, the various lenghts , widths etc. of a given petal should "predict" what particular species of the plant is at hand.

"in comparing methods old and new, and in evaluating any method, it is often considered helpful to try them out on known datasets, thus maintaining some continuity in how we assess methods"

Background on Iris Data Set
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set

This project has introduced the need to become familiar with Data Analysis tools supported by Python such as Numpy, Pandas,
matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn. In order to improve the apparance of outputted data I have come accross modules that helped in various searches and tuturials online....beauti
