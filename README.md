# IrisProject2018
Programming and Scripting Module Project

1. Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it.
2. Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
3. Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
4. Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and mean of each column of the data set.
  A Python script will quickly do this for you.
5. Write a summary of your investigations. 
6. Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary.

Background Information.
The Iris Dataset is a sample of data collected at the time for  R.A. Fisher's 1936 paper, "The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems". Ref the data set contains measures of 4 variables on 3 Species of the Iris plant(Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). The four measures are: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). The sample size is 150.

So in summary:
Sample Size = 150
Variables measured ("Inputs") = 4 (length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres)
Species ("Outputs") = 3 ...setosa, versicolor, virginica

Based on the feature of the 4 variables, Fisher developed a Linear dicriminant model to distinguish the species from eachother.
In "Linear Discriminant Analysis for Machine Learning"(1) By Jason Brownlee on April 6, 2016 in Machine Learning Algorithms (https://machinelearningmastery.com/linear-discriminant-analysis-for-machine-learning/) The (bold)Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is seen as the preferred linear classification technique where you have more than two classes. Statistical data derived from available data is used to make predictions based on LDA equations based on certain assumptions. The statistical tools uses already known groups assignments "to assign objects to one group among a number of groups.(2)

The data set is used demonstrating machine learning is what is described as "Supervised Learning". There is a clear relationship between the known input data available and the expected outputs.

Assumptions..
"That your data is Gaussian, that each variable is is shaped like a bell curve when plotted.
That each attribute has the same variance, that values of each variable vary around the mean by the same amount on average."

It is apparent that this data set is commmonly used as sample data inputted to demonstrate "machine learning" and Predictive Data analyitics.

An inital review of the data shows that the characteristics of the Iris-setosa are distinct in measurements from the Iris-versicolor and virginica.



The analysis of the data and use of graphs gives useful insight to the characteristics of the 3 species of Iris.An inital review of the data shows that the characteristics of the Iris-setosa are distinct in measurements from the Iris-versicolor and virginica.

The key to good data analyitics it is argued is that stored inforamtion is most useful in that it is used to produce new information (Cokins)... it the case of the Iris, the various lenghts , widths etc. of a given petal should "predict" what particular species of the plant is at hand.

"in comparing methods old and new, and in evaluating any method, it is often considered helpful to try them out on known datasets, thus maintaining some continuity in how we assess methods"

Background on Iris Data Set
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set

In the course of working through Python coding to interogate teh data for trends in the data and through researching available functions , modules etc . that surfaced during that effort, it has become apparent there are numerous modules and Python "Add-ons" that make the Data Analysis effort much easier and User friendly for the beginner "Programmer". Inital attempts to calculate the Statistical measures were "clumsy"... lenghty code and messy looking data tables.

It became quickly apparent to me that running a Histogram for all the data combined does not add significant value, only comparisons between the Species and their characterisics demonstartes the relationships and groupings of measures bedendent on the variables.




This project has introduced the need to become familiar with Data Analysis tools supported by Python such as Numpy, Pandas,
matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn. In order to improve the apparance of outputted data I have come accross modules that helped in various searches and tuturials online....beauti

"Data Visualisation (https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/)
We are going to look at two types of plots:
Univariate plots to better understand each attribute.
Multivariate plots to better understand the relationships between attributes.
We start with some univariate plots, that is, plots of each individual variable.... Raw data is Numeric... Histograms
 
 Multivariate Plots
Now we can look at the interactions between the variables.
First, letâ€™s look at scatterplots of all pairs of attributes. This can be helpful to spot structured relationships between input variables".
