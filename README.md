Programming and Scripting Module Project

1. Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it.
2. Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
3. Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
4. Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and mean of each column of the data set.
  A Python script will quickly do this for you.
5. Write a summary of your investigations.
